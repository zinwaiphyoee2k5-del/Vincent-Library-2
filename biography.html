                <!-- Paragraph 1: Introduction -->
                <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings.</p>
                
                <!-- Paragraph 2: Artistic style and challenges -->
                <p>His work is characterized by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive, and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Although he struggled with mental illness and remained poor and virtually unknown throughout his life, his legacy now lives on in every corner of the globe.</p>
                
                <!-- Paragraph 3: Legacy -->
                <p>Today, his masterpieces—from the swirling skies of The Starry Night to the vibrant canvases of his self-portraits—continue to inspire millions with their raw emotion and beauty.</p>
